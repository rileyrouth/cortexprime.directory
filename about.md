The Cortex Prime Directory is a list of every roleplaying game Primed by Cortex -- that is, games that make use of the Cortex Prime system. Why not use it to find your next RPG?

Another great place to find unofficial Cortex content is [The Cortex Prime Hack Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gqFhCn3ttWz6oAo0R5e27r1IXlHr6t0NWenhicGBmvA/).!

Cortex Prime is a product of Dire Wolf Digital, and this is an unofficial resource for fans and players. If you want to submit a game to the directory, please send an email to [riley@rileyrouth.com](mailto:riley@rileyrouth.com).
